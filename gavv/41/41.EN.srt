1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,110
{\an8}<i>It turned out that Glotta was the 
one who took Comel from me.</i>

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,610
{\an8}<i>Dente's death was also on her.</i>

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,220
{\an8}<i>I had lost myself in anger, but his final words to me brought me back to my senses.</i>

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:21,480
{\an8}<i>Helping Shouma protect humans and topple Stomach Inc. will make up for Comel's sins.</i>

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,380
{\an8}<i>With that resolve embedded, 
we defeated Glotta, once and for all.</i>

6
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,850
Glotta-neesan's gone as well...?

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,690
Like she was rushing to be, if anything.

8
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,020
They managed to best <i>Lango-niisan</i>. 
She was never going to win.

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,650
How unfortunate...

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,000
I wanted to get to know her better...

11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,780
Apologies for the wait, my friends.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,420
What did you want to tell us?

13
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:05,310
I've been considering how we could 
mass produce Dark Treats-

14
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,970
Turning the entire human world into a ranch ran through my head.

15
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,000
What do you think?

16
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,820
...your reasons?

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:19,000
Having to inject joy then quietly kidnap them one-by-one takes far too long.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
As such, overtaking their world-

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,890
to have a full supply of human livestock at our fingertips would be far more convenient.

20
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,000
Wonderful! I love it, Papa!

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,620
But sir, with the Granute hunters still there, overtaking their entire <i>world</i> is-

22
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:49,000
Perhaps <i>you</i> could make this work?

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,930
Aaaand that...

24
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,270
- I'm done! 
- Thank you.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,600
You've been coming a lot, lately.

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,000
Not eating just snacks, I hope?

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,110
I'm eating lots of proper meals, too. Don't worry.

28
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,000
Good. Glad to hear it.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
My younger sister was often scolded 
for eating nothing but snacks.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
She must've loved snacking 
as much as I do, huh?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,210
Here.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I <i>gotta</i> snack tons to use you, after all.

33
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,270
What's he doing?

34
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,300
<i>Glasses Creeping Closer
â€Ž 
</i>

35
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,550
{\an8}Me too! I saw people acting all weird.

36
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,060
Eh, you did?

37
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah. Someone was riding a slide repeatedly.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,760
Another was stroking a postbox non-stop.

39
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,770
I just passed it off as them having fun and praying for some prize.

40
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,580
But it's definitely weird, 
now that we're comparing notes.

41
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,280
Mind if I go check things out, after?

42
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,740
People aren't going missing, but still.

43
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,180
Go for it. I'll have a look around myself.

44
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,120
Thanks. Let's have lunch first, though.

45
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,240
That looks yum! Thanks.

46
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,000
- Your favourite soba's on the menu, today. 
- Don't mind if I do, then!

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
"Inoue"

48
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,000
Hello? Inoue-san?

49
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,760
Out, I guess?

50
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,580
I'd recommend trying his store in the daytime, if you're looking for him.

51
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,770
His store?

52
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,060
Could you tell me where it is?

53
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't you reckon Stomach's 
part-timers have been quiet?

54
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,240
But I guess that's to be expected with Lango and Glotta out of the picture.

55
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,790
Still, it's the longest we've gone not sniffing any out since I first got here.

56
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,050
The new CEO's tired of Dark Treats...

57
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,970
would be too optimistic of a take, probably.

58
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,020
My teeth...!

59
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,600
My teeth...!

60
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,900
A Granute?

61
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,020
No...

62
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm gonna eat this rock...!

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,240
Lakia?

64
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,780
Oi.

65
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,070
Give that back! I need to eat my rock!

66
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,870
Why<i> that</i> rock?!

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Rock... Rock... Rock!

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,380
You're gonna kill your teeth!

69
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,920
Lakia, what's going on?!

70
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,670
Shouma?

71
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,720
Check this guy's belly! 
He's not a Granute, right?

72
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,920
Give me my rock!

73
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,060
He's human!

74
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,350
I want to eat my rock! My rock! My rock!

75
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,600
My teeth!

76
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,440
- Don't worry, we'll have that looked that soon. 
- I want my rock! My rock!

77
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,230
Thanks for this!

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thanks, Sachika-san.

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,360
You saved us big time.

80
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,690
Don't mention it.

81
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,000
If this stuff's still going on, then...

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,450
Yeah. Something's definitely up.

83
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,170
Push those buttons.

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,430
That more or less clears simple commands.

85
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,310
Not bad for a first trial, I suppose.

86
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:41,000
President Bocca's a more dangerous 
fellow than I anticipated.

87
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,900
Perhaps <i>you</i> could make this work?

88
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,860
Papa, isn't that-

89
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,700
The corpse of a certain Granute.

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,790
But why have you brought it?

91
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,500
He possessed a particularly unique ability.

92
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,970
One that I wanted to keep within arm's reach to exploit, some day.

93
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,360
And that ability was...?

94
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,390
Something akin to hypnosis.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,480
He could control the actions of others.

96
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,810
Just a tad, mind you.

97
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,190
Heh? A Granute like that existed?

98
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I would've loved to meet him.

99
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:37,460
I suggest we bring humans under 
our control with this ability.

100
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,000
That would simplify the manufacturing of Dark Treats, wouldn't you say, Nyelv-kun?

101
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,170
You poor thing.

102
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:56,020
Vying for Bocca's seat got you assassinated and exploited even after <i>death</i>.

103
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,350
Though, I really shouldn't be judging.

104
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,150
Snacks Cafe Hidamari?

105
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,370
Why does that sound familiar?

106
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,450
- Hi. 
- Welcome.

107
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,710
<i>It's a snacks cafe called "Hidamari".</i>

108
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,370
Right, this is Shouma's usual spot?

109
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,000
Ahh, Shouma-kun's friend from the other day?

110
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,720
My name's Karakida Hanto. 
I'm a freelance writer.

111
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,010
Here.

112
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,620
Are you...Inoue Masaru-san?

113
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,400
Yes. I don't remember introducing myself?

114
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,660
Actually, I'm looking into some 
unsolved missing-persons cases.

115
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,700
Did a family member of yours go missing around twenty years ago?

116
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,620
Yes, actually...

117
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,160
It was my little sister, Michiru.

118
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,000
Inoue Michiru-san?

119
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,390
Wait, did you discover what happened?!

120
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,470
Did you find a lead-

121
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,770
I'm sorry.

122
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:26,770
I've...just been asking around 
about that same name...

123
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,900
 I see.

124
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,570
My apologies.

125
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,700
Another one.

126
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,330
This person's sister's was outside doing a handstand for four hours-

127
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,820
before her arms gave way and they dragged her home.

128
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,790
Do you know where?

129
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:51,920
Mmm...based on other sightings of her...

130
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,760
The intersection at Moriyachou's 
second district, I think?

131
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,970
Moriyachou, second district...

132
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,140
There it is.

133
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,900
The sightings seem to be concentrated around here, at the moment.

134
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,520
One other thing caught my eye.

135
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,770
Some shady guy in a black hood keeps popping up near those spots, apparently.

136
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,320
People online are wondering if its a Granute.

137
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,000
I think I also...

138
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,120
They might be on to something.

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,420
Let's look for that guy around here.

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,670
- Be right back. 
- Take care!

141
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,640
This was her, from around that time.

142
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,680
She'd left for her university classes 
that day, but never came back.

143
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,560
She didn't flee from home, I'm guessing?

144
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,460
The police asked the same, but I can't 
think of any reason she would have.

145
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,700
She had plans with friends at 
a dessert buffet the next day.

146
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,380
You should have seen how excited she was.

147
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,290
She had a sweet tooth, I take it?

148
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,570
She loved snacking in general, not just sweets.

149
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,430
Quite gluttonous too, I might add.

150
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,000
She even joined a snacks circle in her uni.

151
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,000
<i>Yum! It's sweet yet salty, and also springy!</i>

152
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,890
Michiru's still alive out there...

153
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:35,000
Our parents and I continued to hold onto that hope...

154
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,000
But the anxiety ate away at them, and they passed away soon after...

155
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,620
I'm all that's left of our family.

156
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:56,510
<i>This Inoue Michiru has the greatest resemblence to Shouma's mum, so far.</i>

157
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,430
Could I...take a picture of this?

158
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,890
I won't spread it or anything.

159
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,560
Of course. If it helps your search.

160
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,660
Thank you.

161
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,960
"Inoue Shouma"

162
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,450
Sorry, one sec.

163
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,370
What's up?

164
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,460
Huh?

165
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,160
Alright, I'll head over.

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,590
Sorry, something's come up.

167
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,710
I might drop by again.

168
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,800
Let me know if you find anything.

169
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Of course.

170
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,000
Did you...ever tell Shouma about 
what happened to your sister?

171
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,980
I haven't- nor to any of my other customers.

172
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,690
I see.

173
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,440
Thank you for your time. 
Please excuse me.

174
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Take care.

175
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:12,000
<i>What now... 
Should I tell Shouma about this?</i>

176
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:17,000
<i>Thanks. But I think I'm still too afraid.</i>

177
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,200
<i>He's already friends with Masaru-san.</i>

178
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,510
<i>That's probably a good reason keep a lid on it.</i>

179
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,190
<i>What should I do...</i>

180
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:40,880
<i>It's my fault they're dead... 
It's my fault the Stomach family is crumbling...!</i>

181
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,280
<i>What do I do? What do I do, Shiita!?</i>

182
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,000
<i>Help me...!</i>

183
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,250
What's wrong? Not taking Shiita's appearance?

184
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,670
If I wanted to dress up as Shiita...

185
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,620
I'd have to stick her in this black Gavv!

186
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,810
It's disgusting! I don't want that!

187
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,640
Really?

188
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,690
I think it's adorable!

189
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,320
Hey Lizel, am I really on the right track?

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,280
All I wanted was vengeance for Shiita-

191
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,750
and to get back a little at Lango-niisan...

192
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:41,460
But now he and Glotta-neesan 
are dead, because of me...

193
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,630
on top of my Gavv becoming <i>this</i>...

194
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,850
The future I had in mind is getting further away...

195
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,140
I'm scared...

196
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,490
A lot's changed, and it's shaken you up.

197
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,000
Things will be fine. You still have me!

198
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,620
Lango and Glotta got what was coming to them.

199
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,500
Don't blame yourself for that!

200
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,000
You just need to keep on keeping on!

201
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,670
I want to get stronger.

202
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,220
Then let's start by giving 
that Gavv a little clean!

203
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
- Go check over there. 
- 'Kay.

204
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,400
Lakia!

205
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,000
Dance.

206
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,000
So this <i>was</i> his doing.

207
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,340
Stop!

208
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,320
Shady freak.

209
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,390
Show me that face!

210
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,120
Suga!?

211
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,960
You've got some balls getting 
up to this crap again...!

212
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,060
What is it now!? 
What are you planning!?

213
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,300
There's nothing going on in his head.

214
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,880
Hanto!

215
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,640
Nyelv.

216
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,000
He's not the Suga-san you remember. Not anymore.

217
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,140
He's just a mindless marionette of mine, now.

218
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,570
That body...

219
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,620
Did you modify him as well?!

220
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,820
I picked him up after you 
lot beat him down,

221
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,410
and kept him alive, thinking I could use him,

222
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,000
until I obtained a peculiar 
Granute's corpse, recently.

223
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,370
So I used him as a lab rat.

224
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,520
That's vile...

225
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,960
I'd agree.

226
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,800
His body actually gave out and died when I was splicing the black Gavv on-

227
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,900
turning him into a nice obedient zombie.

228
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,980
But Suga-san was all about making the 
ultimate life form, so it works out for him.

229
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,360
Now it's adding up.

230
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,990
Doing this to Suga-san, 
and those people acting strangely-

231
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,700
were experiments to control humans.

232
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,620
What's the next step!?

233
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,700
True. What could it be?

234
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,740
People's lives aren't your toys!

235
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,170
Prepare yourself, Nyelv!

236
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,300

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,780
I <i>did</i> fiddle with him.

255
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,220
By the way, those explode.

256
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,000
Over here, Suga-san!

257
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,120
- Ready, and- 
- Let go!

258
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,630
Gavv and Vram are your enemies.

259
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,380
Bastard... You're trying to puppet me as well?!

260
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,050
Not happening!!

261
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,420
I decide what I do!!

262
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,640
Destroy Gavv and Vram.

263
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,690
Destroy Gavv and Vram.

264
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,040

267
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,460
It still affects you despite your 
current strength, thankfully.

268
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:17,000
This is all my natural ability amounts to, 
unlike our older brother.

269
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,460

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,600

274
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,180
