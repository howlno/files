1
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,140
{\an8}Go ahead. Make that nightmare of yours come true.

2
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,560
{\an8}<i>I'm Baku Yorozu.</i>

3
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,600
{\an8}<i>I'm an agent for the
Secret Defense Organization, CODE.</i>

4
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,520
{\an8}<i>My mission... to eradicate evil.</i>

5
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,590
{\an8}<i>At least, that's what I dream about every night.</i>

6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,390
{\an8}<i>I'm actually a pretty normal guy.</i>

7
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,230
{\an8}<i>Tonight's mission:</i>

8
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,350
{\an8}<i>Stop the bomber.</i>

9
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,200
<i>But...</i>

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,420
<i>For some reason, I'm the one being chased?!</i>

11
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,570
Hey you! Stop right there!

12
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,990
You won't get away!

13
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,880
Why is this what I'm dreaming about?!

14
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,520
<i>Good luck.</i>

15
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,890
Hey!

16
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,330
Code number: 7.

17
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,100
Good night to you!

18
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,550
Nem!

19
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,720
Good night.

20
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,000
CASE 2: EXPLODE

21
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,620
{\an8}For some reason, I'm being chased.

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,520
Oh! That's it!

23
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,210
My mission must be to protect you,
our national star.

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,200
It must be tough, huh?

25
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,870
Having to play secret agent
even in your dreams...

26
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,300
It's nothing.

27
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,080
Wait!

28
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,230
You know this is a dream?

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,100
Yes.  But I just take in my surroundings, and play my role accordingly!

30
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,830
Nem, you're a diabolical one.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,320
Anyway...

32
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,380
Watch the O as it becomes a 3!

33
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:31,960
OK!

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,160
Close the 3 again and

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,510
buddy, you're busted!

36
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,430
What?!

37
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,960
Wanted criminal Baku Yorozu,
you're under arrest.

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,350
Why are you arresting me?!

39
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,270
Because the role I'm playing is...

40
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,270
Police Chief for a Day!

41
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,380
It's that monster again.

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,790
I'm gonna blow everything up.

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,510
I see now.

44
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,730
So you're the bomber.

45
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,200
Oh right, cuffed.

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,810
Nem, take it off!

47
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,360
 I can't do that as an officer of the law..!

48
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,390
No, you've gotta!

49
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,820
IMPACT

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,140
Woah, you're a useful little thing.

51
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,830
{\an8}<i>Stop the bomber...</i>

52
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,410
That's my mission.

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,300
IMPACT

54
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,170
MEZTZAMERO! MEZTZAMERO!

55
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,090
{\an8}<i>I'm on it.</i>

56
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,390
Transform!

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,390
GOOD MORNING! RIDER!

58
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,490
Z-ZEZ-ZEZTZ!

59
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,860
IMPACT

60
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,910
Whoops!

61
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,070
You can't stop this nightmare!

62
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,190
No way, no way, no way, no way!

63
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,130
Hey! Did you cause that blast?!

64
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,080
Get him!

65
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,510
No! No, no, no, no, no!

66
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,850
The heck was with that dream?

67
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,130
<i>Something's weird here.</i>

68
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,270
<i>I can usually control my lucid dreams.</i>

69
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,720
<i>This weird thing I was wearing
in a dream the other day</i>

70
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,200
<i>was still on me when I woke up,
for some reason.</i>

71
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,160
Transform!

72
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,370
Wait... Maybe I can transform in real life, too?

73
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,460
I'll put this on...

74
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,680
TOKYO METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT
TOKYO PUBLIC SECURITY COMMITTEE

75
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,270
PARANORMAL AFFAIRS DIVISION

76
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,950
I'm already on the outside looking in...

77
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,310
I'm this young and I'm being demoted...?

78
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,500
No. It's not possible.

79
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,620
I'm a competent woman.

80
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,040
Ow...

81
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,970
GOOD MORNING, CHIEF FUJIMI!

82
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,860
Morning.

83
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,310
I'm impressed you made it, Nasuka.

84
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,680
Only my parents can call me by my first name.

85
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,860
Sir, have you been here all night?

86
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,450
Yeah.

87
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,880
{\an8}CLASSIFIED

88
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,650
You're still looking into Baku Yorozu?

89
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,050
Sit down, will ya.

90
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,750
Yes, sir.

91
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,090
C'mon, we're leaving. Get ready.

92
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,580
Huh? Wait, where to?!

93
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,980
If Baku Yorozu met a Nightmare,
he might be about to commit a violent crime.

94
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,520
There's no scientific basis for that.

95
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,530
Yes, there is!

96
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,430
His injury from two days ago healed so fast, they cut him loose yesterday.

97
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,890
These circumstances are clearly inexplicable.

98
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,590
This is a Black Case.

99
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,330
He's hiding something.

100
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,680
Real suspicious.

101
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,290
Is it really?

102
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,960
HIIISSS!

103
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,630
Pretty sure "Meow" would've worked better.

104
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:40,940
Hiss!

105
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,810
Mr. Baku Yorozu?

106
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,560
What?

107
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,630
What theâ€”?! You're...!

108
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,930
MPD, Fujimi...

109
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,590
And Nagumo.

110
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,280
Sorry to bother you so soon
after your discharge,

111
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,600
but please accompany us to the station.

112
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,900
Huh, why?!

113
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,270
We can't force you to come.

114
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,690
My dream's coming true.

115
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,760
You're arresting me! I'm a wanted man!

116
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,150
No, neither of those things is the case.

117
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,910
What do you have hiding there?

118
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,710
I'm not so sure, myself...

119
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,340
I saw it in my dream, and
I woke up with it, for some reason.

120
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,740
Do you remember what the dream was about?!

121
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,800
Yeah. I ran into Nem...

122
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,200
Nem?

123
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,940
Yeah.

124
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,420
So what?!

125
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,270
She appears in<i> everyone's</i> dreams, you know!

126
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,480
Mine as well.

127
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,450
No, that wasn't all!

128
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,530
Suddenly, a demon-looking thing suddenly appeared...

129
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,940
Did you...

130
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,650
Did you meet a Nightmare?

131
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,490
- A Nightmare?
- Yes.

132
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,530
You mean... that monster?!

133
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,420
Yes!

134
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,940
Tell me everything!

135
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,460
What was the dream like?!

136
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,520
Was that a Nightmare?!

137
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,510
Tone it down, sir, or I'll arrest <i>you.</i>

138
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,490
One shot a gun at me,
one blew up a bunch of police cars...

139
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,420
Impossible.

140
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,590
That's the same dream I had yesterday!

141
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,600
What? You did?

142
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,240
The same dream! The same dream!

143
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,560
The same! The same dream!

144
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,140
The same dream!

145
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,250
Different people having the same dream...

146
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,200
It's completely inexplicable, a Black Case!

147
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,280
A Black Case?

148
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,250
The Paranormal Affairs Division deals with unsolved cases that seem logically inexplicable.

149
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,950
And... I suspect the Nightmares are behind them.

150
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,360
- The Nightmares?!
- Yes.

151
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,130
Nasuka. The case files.

152
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,920
They're classified, he's not authorized, and there's no scientifi...

153
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,340
Just hand them over.

154
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,470
Nightmares are monsters that appear in your dreams when you're sleeping.

155
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,500
We don't know how they appear or what it is they're after.

156
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,860
What we do know...

157
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,200
is that they force people to have bad dreams.

158
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,560
That doesn't mean anything.
Sometimes dreams are like that!

159
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,000
These aren't just dreams.

160
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,970
What you're describing is the purview
of urban legends and occult magazines.

161
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,460
Our duty as police officers is to solve crimes that <i>actually</i> happen!

162
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,920
Becoming a police officer was my dream.

163
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,560
What?

164
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,720
I want to believe in my duty...

165
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,800
In the mission
of the Paranormal Affairs Division.

166
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,590
Totally a demotion...

167
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,070
I've been demoted...

168
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,450
The police?!

169
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,620
What have you gotten yourself into this time?

170
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,840
Nothing, nothing! They just
had some questions about a case.

171
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,690
Oh, well. I guess that's
a one-in-a-hundred thing.

172
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,070
Unlucky you.

173
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,740
Guess so.

174
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,510
So heavy.

175
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,830
Hey, Minami. Have you ever had
the same dream as someone else?

176
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,030
What? Don't be ridiculous.

177
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,070
Yeah, I figured...

178
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,990
But the thing about dreams is...

179
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,320
They say that they're a manifestation of a person's subconscious.

180
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,460
They're a world that you've created.

181
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,700
A world only you can see!

182
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,730
Fair enough.

183
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,020
What's wrong?

184
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,560
- What is it?
- Stay back!

185
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,530
You just helped me by carrying our groceries.

186
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,200
Something's gonna happe... No, stay back!

187
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,960
Could be a meteorite or an explosion, I just really don't wanna be a part of that.

188
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,520
You drama queen. I'm leaving.

189
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,760
It might happen, though!

190
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,690
I stepped in poo!

191
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,770
I warned you!

192
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,910
What do I do?!

193
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,720
- Wash it off! Wash it off.
- Wash this?!

194
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,550
- I'll take this and head back home first.
 - Wait, what?!

195
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,190
- Please! Stay back! Go away!
- You're just gonna leave me?!

196
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,430
Man!

197
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,740
I'm so curious, I can't sleep!

198
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,010
Who's calling me?

199
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,530
{\an8}<i>Are you going to abandon your duties?</i>

200
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,880
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you're saying.

201
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,780
My dream self understands
English, but I don't.

202
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,360
{\an8}<i>...Okay.</i>

203
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,970
{\an8}<i>I asked if you're going to abandon your duties?</i>

204
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,040
Excuse me. May I ask who you're trying to reach?

205
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,450
{\an8}<i>Code number: 7.</i>

206
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,690
Wait a minute.

207
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,190
I thought I was only a secret agent in my dreams.

208
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,690
I'm sure as heck wide awake right now!

209
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,890
{\an8}<i>Open the closet door.</i>

210
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,710
The voice is coming from here?

211
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,130
Huh?

212
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,230
What's this thing?

213
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,520
Hey, my clothes!

214
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,860
Huh?

215
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:48,920
Huh?

216
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,490
HUH?!

217
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,750
What is this place?

218
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,800
{\an8}<i>This is a control center
we've prepared for you.</i>

219
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,550
{\an8}<i>We'd like you to take on missions
as one of our agents.</i>

220
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,030
Zero?

221
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,920
Where's that voice coming from?

222
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,840
It's me.

223
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,710
Zero, you're a robot?!

224
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,510
No, I'm being controlled remotely.

225
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,530
Wait, hang on!

226
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,830
Am I really a secret agent now?!

227
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,900
With enough faith
your dreams can come true.

228
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,070
You have one duty.

229
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,160
Infiltrate the dreams of others,

230
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,890
and stop the Nightmares' bad dreams
before they come to pass.

231
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,900
I will be supporting your
operations in the field.

232
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,840
These items contain the power
to make dreams come true.

233
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,400
Give it a spin.

234
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,310
Here goes...

235
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,100
What's this thing?

236
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,060
Here.

237
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:40,110
"Transform. The power
to change your body's shape."

238
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,450
It should be useful on your mission.

239
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,100
Wait a minute.

240
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,280
Zero, you just said... I have to stop the Nightmares'
bad dreams before they come to pass.

241
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,710
Indeed.

242
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,770
When a Nightmare gives a Dreamer
their ultimate bad dream,

243
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,350
the Dreamer becomes locked away
in darkness, never to awaken again.

244
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,670
Never to awaken...?

245
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:07,380
Because the Nightmare will
have taken over their body.

246
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,260
Wait.

247
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,440
Then I'll have to stop the bomber, or else the Dreamer will...

248
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,600
Wait a minute!
What was that thing you said before?!

249
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,660
With enough faith...

250
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,400
No, after that!

251
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,940
You have one duty.

252
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,690
Infiltrate the dreams of others...

253
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,330
Yeah, that part!

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,110
<i>Impossible.</i>

255
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,070
<i>That's the same dream I had yesterday!</i>

256
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,990
That was...

257
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,190
Mr. Fujimi's dream...?

258
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,480
It appears the bomber
has hijacked a police van.

259
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,960
I've gotta stop the Bomber or else Mr. Fuijimi will be in danger...!

260
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,760
{\an8}<i>I'm ready.</i>

261
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,450
Zero!

262
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,350
You can enter my dreams, too?!

263
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,560
{\an8}<i>Of course.</i>

264
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,900
{\an8}<i>Come on. Let's stop the bomber.</i>

265
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:12,670
Vroom... Vrvrvrooommm!

266
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,540
Why am I getting on your back?!

267
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,540
{\an8}<i>Ah, it's just a witty joke.</i>

268
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,360
IMPACT

269
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,700
MEZTZAMERO!

270
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,510
Transform!

271
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,790
GOOD MORNING! RIDER!

272
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,020
Z-ZEZ-ZEZTZ!

273
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,650
I'll carry out my mission.

274
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,620
Not bad.

275
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,680
OMI POLICE STATION

276
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,180
He's after the police precinct?!

277
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,090
TRANSFORM

278
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,160
GOOD MORNING! RIDER!

279
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,930
Z-ZEZ-ZEZTZ!

280
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,660
TRANSFORM

281
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,070
{\an8}<i>Use this weapon.</i>

282
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,200
SWORD MODE

283
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:58,130
If I eliminate you, I save Mr. Fujimi, right?

284
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,300
Dreams...

285
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,530
are a reflection of the Dreamer's subconscious.

286
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,560
Who's there?!

287
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,680
Dreams...

288
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,930
are the refuge of wishes left
ungranted in the real world.

289
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,350
The Dreamer's subconscious...

290
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:25,390
When the Mind's Door is opened,
the nightmare will begin.

291
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,450
It can't be...

292
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,090
The person wishing
for this bomber nightmare...

293
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,160
is the Dreamer, Mr. Fujimi, himself?

294
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,730
Why, Mr. Fujimi?

295
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,980
{\an8}<i>Next time on Kamen Rider Zeztz:</i>

296
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,320
{\an8}You must find the Mind's Doors
somewhere in the dream world.

297
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,230
{\an8}What have I been doing up until now...?

298
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,990
{\an8}I want to protect Mr. Fujimi's dream.

299
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,540
{\an8}The only one who can do that, is Zeztz.

300
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,660
{\an8}I've made your dream come true.

301
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,620
{\an8}Where are you?! You Nightmare?!

302
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,510
{\an8}O' world, awaken to a nightmare!

303
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,750
{\an8}If we donâ€™t hurry and stop the Nightmares, the world will end.

304
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,210
{\an8}<i>Stop the bomber...</i>

305
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,360
{\an8}I'll carry out my mission!

306
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,790
CASE 3: ERODE
