00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,660
<i>The nightmare scenario is just one hour away.</i>

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,210
<i>Nem, the national celebrity who's
 the face of countless advertisements,</i>

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,380
<i>was kidnapped by a heartless crime syndicate,</i>

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,550
<i>was demanded the ransom be crowdfunded
 by people all over the country.</i>

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,550
<i>Her location has not yet been determined.</i>

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,310
{\an8}<i>Your mission is to save the target.</i>

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,560
{\an8}Will our national nightmare come true?

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,230
Oh, Nem...

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,820
Trust those tears to me.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,740
Time's up.

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,970
We reached ten billion in just one week!

12
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,600
Can you feel it? The nation loves you!

13
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,930
But if you think that means
you get to live, tough luck.

14
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,720
We'll take the ten billion,
and you get to die.

15
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,400
Can you imagine a better finale?!

16
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,980
Give the people back their money!

17
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,410
Whatever. Kill her.

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,930
Who the hell are you?

19
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,610
An agent for the Secret Defense Organization: CODE.

20
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,190
Say what?

21
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,030
Stupid cowlick! Stay in place already!

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,120
Code number: 7. Executing mission.

23
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,380
{\an8}<i>Okay. Good luck.</i>

24
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,540

YUKI FURUKAWA

29
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,440
You're safe now.

30
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,680
Thank you very much.

31
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,680
May I ask your name?

32
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,960
Code number: 7.

33
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,990
A nameless secret agent.

34
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,630
Wow!

35
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,040
Hey, wake up already!

36
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,110
You slept long enough, my stupid brother.

37
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,500
You're supposed to handle
breakfast today, remember?

38
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,010
And look at this! It's supposed to dry flat!

39
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,920
Darn it. I'd just saved Nem
and it was going so great...

40
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,340
I mean, I wish I could do what you do...

41
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,160
{\an8}Every night you dream
about being a secret agent...

42
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,550
{\an8}And you said they're lucid dreams, right?

43
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,350
It would be great to enjoy dreams,
knowing that's what they were.

44
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,850
If only I could control real life so easily...

45
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,970
They're still just dreams, though.

46
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,880
I think I'd be so great
at helping people, though.

47
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,820
I wish I could get a job where I—

48
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,820
Don't.

49
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,490
Minami?

50
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,910
Sorry.

51
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,000
Just... please, save the dreams
for bedtime, okay?

52
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,820
Okay.

53
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,510
Even so...

54
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,900
I've gotta find a way
to pull my weight for Minami.

55
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,690
Chin up!

56
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,340
Right!

57
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,080
Don't be satisfied by dreaming.

58
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,190
Make those dreams come true!

59
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,100
You're right.

60
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,150
Right!

61
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,090
Can you do it? Let's find out!

62
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,240
Look! A bunny!

63
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,380
Mr. Baku Yorozu?

64
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,560
Coming.

65
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,690
Be back in a second.

66
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,330
What kind of work are you looking for?

67
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,080
Secret agent.

68
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Pardon?

69
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,300
Pardon?

70
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,080
Oh, no...

71
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,480
{\an8}I'd like a job where I can help people.

72
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,160
{\an8}Every job involves helping <i>someone</i>...

73
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,160
Let's buy you a new one.

74
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,670
How about this one?

75
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,820
Kaede?

76
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,390
Kaede?!

77
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,550
{\an8}Kaede! Where are you, Kaede?!

78
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,550
Wait, was he...

79
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,470
Don't worry. You can do this.

80
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,370
Don't go with him!

81
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,340
Now, make our nightmare come true.

82
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,100
Hey, hey, hey now!

83
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,780
Hey, wait!

84
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,850
Hey! Hey!

85
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,650
Hang in there! Hey!

86
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,030
Someone! Call an ambulance!

87
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,100
Call a—

88
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,090
They say you were hit by a car
while trying to save a little girl...

89
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,270
Is that true?

90
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,550
I do that kind of thing in my dreams,
so I thought maybe I could in real life.

91
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,230
That's why I keep saying,
save the dreams for bedtime!

92
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,480
You've got world-class bad luck, remember?

93
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,690
Every time you try to save someone in
real life, it just turns into a nightmare!

94
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,790
Your fate is written in the stars—
the gods have given up on you!

95
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,200
Man, that's harsh.

96
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,740
But...

97
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,420
What do dreams matter,
if you can't make them come true?

98
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:49,100
You're still alive after all those close calls.

99
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,430
That's enough to be happy about, right?

100
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,290
I'll stop at home to get your things.

101
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,210
Coming through.

102
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,490
Ma'am.

103
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,390
{\an8}Division Chief Fujimi?

104
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,550
{\an8}I've just been assigned
to the Paranormal Affairs Division.

105
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,080
{\an8}I'm Nasuka Nagumo.

106
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,840
{\an8}Hell of a way to get started, huh?

107
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,680
{\an8}It's fine. It's my duty.

108
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,530
Was it an accident?

109
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,810
Yeah.

110
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,250
But there was no driver.

111
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,240
No driver? Is that possible?

112
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,680
You just got here,
so I realize you wouldn't get it,

113
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,940
but the world's full of these "Black Cases"—

114
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,780
mysterious incidents with no known explanation.

115
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,860
Mysterious deaths,

116
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,810
disappearances...

117
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,850
They manifest in a variety of ways.

118
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,380
If the PSB is looking into them,

119
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,710
they must represent a serious threat
to national security.

120
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,420
Good bet.

121
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,390
We already have a clue
to what's causing the Black Cases.

122
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,230
They appear to people while they sleep...

123
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,470
Yep. Invaders from our worst dreams—

124
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,600
Nightmares.

125
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,170
What the hell?!

126
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,390
Someone—

127
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,770
Someone help!

128
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,640
Why isn't anyone here?

129
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,090
You seem afraid to die.

130
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,250
What's going on?

131
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,340
My room?

132
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,140
Minami!

133
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,330
What the...

134
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,790
Nem?

135
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,380
Help me!

136
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,110
Why not keep running?

137
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,780
It's all too impossible.

138
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,090
I was going to catch on eventually.

139
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm dreaming.

140
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,740
I dozed off at some point.

141
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,190
Which means there's nothing to be scared of.

142
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:57,380
Because I'm code number: 7,
the invincible agent.

143
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,870
Why? This is a lucid dream...

144
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,850
It's supposed to go the way I want it to!

145
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,530
That's always been your delusion.

146
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,280
I'll turn it into a nightmare.

147
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,290
This can't be...

148
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,820
<i>The thoughts always been there,
in the depths of your subconscious—</i>

149
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,140
<i>You'll never make your dreams come true.</i>

150
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,380
You're wrong!

151
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,270
<i>You don't have the power to save anyone.</i>

152
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,350
No...

153
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,770
{\an8}Mr. Yorozu? Can you hear me?

154
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,770
What's his status?

155
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,570
He's in cardiac arrest.

156
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,860
Chest compressions. Get him on oxygen.

157
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,980
Sir.

158
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,600
You're helpless.

159
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,570
<i>Completely helpless.</i>

160
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,310
<i>You can't save anyone.</i>

161
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,150
<i>The ultimate nightmare...</i>

162
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,490
It's time to face it.

163
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:35,440
You're still alive after all those close calls.

164
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
That's enough to be happy about, right?

165
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,820
And yet... I'm still alive.

166
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,190
Alive, yet with nothing to drive you.

167
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,750
I can't deny that...

168
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,340
But still... at least in my own mind...

169
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,460
It's okay to make my dreams come true
the way I want them, right?

170
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,190
Escapism, no more.

171
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,680
You're afraid of living in reality.

172
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,200
That's not up to you.

173
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,520
I know my own mind...

174
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,140
better than anyone.

175
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,500
Where am I?

176
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,360
<i>You've come a long way.</i>

177
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,770
That voice...

178
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,210
Commander Zero?!

179
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,040
This place is your subconscious mind.

180
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,770
Make your dream come true.

181
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,150
Good luck.

182
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,640
You can't stop this nightmare.

183
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,270
Save the target.

184
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,580
That's my mission.

185
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm the invincible agent.

186
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,770
IMPACT

187
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:48,300
MEZZZAMERO! MEZZZAMERO! MEZZZAMERO!

188
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,920
I'm on it.

189
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,820
Transform!

190
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,370
GOOD MORNING! RIDER!

191
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,800
Z-ZEZ-ZEZTZ!

192
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,210
IMPACT

193
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,360
I'll carry out my mission.

194
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,220
I wish you'd fall in line already...

195
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,150
My dream belongs to me!

196
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,140
What?!

197
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,300
Fade away.

198
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,510
IMPACT

199
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,080
BANISH

200
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,100
Z-ZEZ-ZEZTZ!

201
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,910
Mission complete.

202
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,550
Seven!

203
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,090
Nem!

204
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,550
I'm so glad you're safe.

205
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,640
<i>It was all just a dream.</i>

206
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,540
Big Brother!

207
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,880
I had a bad dream.

208
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,970
But I helped someone.

209
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,780
Get a grip already, stupid brother.

210
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,510
I don't understand.

211
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,540
The Nightmares are real.

212
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,060
If you don't believe me, leave.

213
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,780
Fine by me.

214
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,540
There's something only the mind knows...

215
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,070
When your dreams go to sleep,

216
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,730
the world awakens to a nightmare.

217
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,090
What is that?

218
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,640
It <i>wasn't</i> a dream?!

219
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,440
{\an8}<i>Next time on KAMEN RIDER ZEZTZ:</i>

220
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,690
{\an8}Wanted criminal Baku Yorozu,
you're under arrest.

221
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,150
{\an8}Why am I under arrest?!

222
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,900
{\an8}Infiltrate the dreams of others,

223
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,440
{\an8}and stop the Nightmares' bad dreams
before they come to pass.

224
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,910
{\an8}Our duty as police officers is solving
 crimes that <i>actually</i> happen!

225
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,830
{\an8}I'm gonna blow up everything.

226
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,290
{\an8}If I don't stop that bomber,
 they'll all be in danger!

227
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,160
{\an8}When the door to one's heart opens,

228
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,130
{\an8}the nightmare begins.

229
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,910
{\an8}I'll carry out my mission.

230
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,750
CASE 2: EXPLODE
